# Lessons from my past projects

## 0. `---` | MINE AGH Challenge: "Colors"

### Result: [Project did not conclude](./Lessons_from_past_filmmaking_projects__Jan_Karpiuk.md)

### Bad:

- **`Don't fear asking for help with anything.` Nobody's out to steal your idea. It is shitty anyway.**

    ASK FOR HELP! NOTHING WORST THAN YOU NOT MAKING YOUR IDEA A REALITY CAN HAPPEN!

- **`Check what equipement you have avaliable for your shoot.` Have someone more experienced walk you through the purpose, and use of every piece of equipement. Take notes.**

    DO NOT PRESUME YOU WILL FIGURE THE EQUIPMENT OUT DURING THE SHOOT! YOU WILL MOST LIKELY NOT!
  
### Good:

+ **`Make reaserch` on the types of shots, shooting a specific subject, you want in your footage.**

    THERE IS A LOT OF REFERENCE MATERIAL AND TUTORIALS OUT THERE. LEARN FROM THESE.

## 1. `"FENIX MATCHES"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "Advertisement"

### Result: [FENIX MATCHES | Advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67lx43Paau8)

### Bad:

- **`Shooting in the dark REQUIRES a camera made for that purpose.` Othervise prepare for a lot of noise in your video!**

    SOME NOISE IS ACCEPTABLE. TO MUCH AND NO DENOISIFIER SOFTWARE WONT BE ABLE TO HELP YOUR ASS!
    OH, YOU WANT TO SHOOT IN COMPLETE DARKNESS, HMMM...? GO INFRARED, IDIOT.
    FILM IS PAINTING WITH LIGHT. NO LIGHT - NO PAINTING.

- **Do not shoot on public or private roads at night, without any lights. You will get run over ba a vehicle.**

  `THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE SHOOTING, AND THE DANGERS IT PRESENTS TO YOU, YOUR CREW, AND THE EQUIPMENT.`

### Good:

+ **Have a more experienced person handle the stuff you can not yet do**
  
    `LEARN FROM MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE.` SAVE TIME DURING THE SHOOT.

+ **`Think about the equipment you will need for your shots`**

    IF YOUR SUBJECT IS A DANGER TO YOU OR THE EQUIPMENT, IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE AND USE A NARROW LENSE.

+ **`Done is better than perfect / finished`**

    IF YOU HAVE REACHED YOUR BEST OR RUN OUT OF TIME, AND YOU STILL THINK THE VIDEO LOOKS BAD. SHOW IT TO OTHERS, MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE ANYWAY. AT LEAST YOU DID SOMETHING!

## 2. `"(A)SYMMETRY"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "(a)symmetry"

### Result: [(A)SYMMETRY | Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE9tMI3Jd1k)

### Bad:

- **`Two different temperature light sources in one shot >:C`**
  
    PAIN IN COLOR CORRECTION!

- **You can `correct for lense warp in post production`**
  
    IT IS POSSIBLE! NO STRAIGHT WALLS BENDING AT THE FRAME EDGE!

- **`Have at least one other person to help you shoot`**

    FRIENDS MAKE LIFE EASIER! THERE MIGHT BE (WILL BE) UNEXPECTED, ON LOCATION PROBLEMS WHITCH CAN'T BE SOLVED ON YOUR OWN!

### Good:

+ **`Make a shitty previz video in an hour`. Shoot it even with your shitty phone camera.**

    TEST THE IDEA BEFORE YOU COMMIT TO IT. YOU WILL SEE HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE UPPON THE INITIAL CONCEPT.

+ **`Have a piece of white paper for referencing the color temperature`**

    HELP YOURSELF IN POSTPRODUCTION. I KNOW, TEDIOUS EXTRA FEW SECONDS IN EVERY SHOT... YOU WILL THANK YOURSELF LATER. TRUST ME IT IS WORTH IT.

## 3. `"PAPER MAILMAN"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "Water"


### Result: [PAPER MAILMAN | Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtCTOG7gCSQ)

### Bad:

- **`Selection and Edit are not 80% of the job in post production!` They are only 50%!**

    DON'T PLAN YOUR SHEDULE THINKING THAT EDITED FOTTAGE IS BASICLY A DONE FILM. YOU MIGHT PUT EQUAL, IF NOT MORE, TIME IN SOUND DESIGN AND COLORING.

- **`Have a proper shotlist ready`**

    A SHOTLIST WILL SAVE YOU TIME ON LOCATION. YOU CAN ALWAYS EXPERIMENT AND SEARCH FOR EXTRA SHOTS WHEN YOU FINISH THE MAIN ONES.

- **`Bring a pencil and an eraser to the set. In fact bring a whole pencilcase.` You never know when you will need some basic drawing supplies.**

    A PENCIL WILL NOT GET WET OR STOP WORKING + YOU CAN ERASE IT.

- **`Make notes judging the shots you have made`**

    SAVE TIME SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT SHOTS IN POSTPRODUCTION.

- **It is not enough to have a story and shots planed out. `You need to know how the shots will connect in the editing.`**

    PLAN YOUR SHOTS WITH THE EDITING IN MIND, NOT ONLY THE STORY!

- **For `shots with a narrower lense use more stabilization` than a shoulder rig. A tripod or at least a gyro-stabilizer is in order.**

    BE MINDFULL OF HOW MUCH STABLILIZATION YOU NEED FOR WHICH LENSE.

- **For a shoot longer than 2h, `take a snack with you.`**

    YOU ARE A LIVING BEING. YOU NEED SUSTENANCE! YOUR HEAD WILL HURT OTHERWISE.

### Good:

+ **`Scout the location for possible shots beforehand.` Take lots of pictures!**

    IF YOUR SHOOT IS MORE ELABORATE, AND NEEDS TO TELL A COHERENT STORY GO TO THE LOCATION AT LEAST TWICE. IT WILL HELP YOU COME UP WITH THE SHOTS. IT WILL ALSO SAVE TIME DURING THE SHOOTING.

+ **You can `incorporate the white surface for referencing light temperature into your subject's design.` Have it always visible in your shots.**

    NO NEED TO WASTE TIME ON LOCATION.

+ **If you have any `extra batteries avaliable, even partialy charged, and wondering if you should take them... Take those batteries!!!`**

    TAKE EVERY SPARE BATTERY YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON!!! TAKE A CHARGER TOO, IF YOU CAN.

+ **`Shoot some b-roll footage in between main shots.` You never know when you might need a cutaway in editing!**

    B-ROLL IS A SAFETY NET FOR YOUR SHITTY OR MISSING MAIN SHOTS. TAKE CARE TO HAVE SOME.

+ **`B-roll makes great material for location establishing shots` (not only wide shots, but close-ups as well - Sometimes less is more).**

    B-ROLL IS EASY TO SHOOT. YOU CAN MAKE LOTS OF IT. SOME IS BOUND TO BE USEFULL.

+ **`Mark shots that are requred for your story to make sence` in your shotlist. `Shoot these first.`**

    THE MAIN STORY SHOTS TAKE PRIORITY OVER THE PREETTY ONES!

+ **If you are `shooting in multiple locations` (even locations close by), `plan the shoot beforehand!`**

    SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF TIME AND PHYSICAL LABOUR ON LOCATION!
