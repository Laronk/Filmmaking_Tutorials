## 2. `"Wyjdź z cienia"` | CM AGH complementary recruitment video (03.03.2023)

**Role:** Gaffer, PA, Cinematographer's assistant

### Result: [Rekrutacja uzupełniająca CM AGH 2022/23](https://www.facebook.com/centrummediowagh/videos/903271134425933)

### Notes

-

### Bad

- **`Look at your subject through the camera as well as with a naked eye.` Camera's additional features can sometimes obscure important detail, like light reflections.**

    Small light reflexes can be hidden by camera focus assist. Often light refelexes are unwanted in surfaces like actor's glasses. When checking for reflexes in camera, keep in mind that thick focus assist clorfull indicators can make them harder to spot.

### Good

- **`Practical lights, might not be powerfull enough to illuminate the subject in high-key lighting setup.` Help the practical ligth with a hidden, stronger light of the same color/temperature.**

    TOO MUCH AMBIENT LIGHT CAN OVERWHELM THE PRACTICAL LIGHTS, SINCE THEY ARE MOST COMMONLY FAINT. IN THOSE CASES, WHERE YOU CAN NOT OR DO NOT WANT TO DECREASE THE OVERAL AMBIENT LIGHT (THE ENVIRONMENT NEEDS TO BE WELL LIT), CONSIDER USING A STRONGER DIRECTED LIGHT TO SUPPORT THE PRACTICAL. MAKE IT SEEM AS THE LIGHT IS COMMING FROM THE PRACTICAL.

## 3. `"---"` | Friend's bachelor thesis film (04.03.2023)

**ROLE:** Gaffer's assistant, PA

### Notes

- Nie wyłączać lamp żarowych przyciskiem (On/Off), gdy są rozgrzane. Należy najpierw "zdimmować" światło i jeśli nie jest konieczne wyłączenie lampy od prądu, to można ją zostawić w takim wygaszonym stanie. Gwałtowne wyłączenie (skok napięcia) może spalić rozgrzany żarnik.  

- Kino Flo - firma i typ lampy fluorescencyjnej

- Ośmiorniczka - kabel do podpinania lamp fluorescencyjnych

- Dimmery - zmiana natężenia światła i\lub jego barwy

- Jumbo - duża lampa żarowa 2kW 3200K

## 4. `"Płacz nad rozlanym. Preludium"` | Photo vernissage BIS & KSAF AGH (12.05.2023)

### [Project poster](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=722732092995800&set=a.539586634643681)

**ROLE:** Gaffer

### Bad

- **`When mounting LED stick lights make sure they aren't pressed up against anything that could dent the plastic when it will inevitably heat up.`**

    LED stick lights don't heat as much as incandescent lightbulbs do, but it is enough to heat up the diffusing plastic material they are encased in (especially if left on for longer periods). The heated-up plastic casing is subject to deformation under pressure and in extreme cases can be damaged beyond repair (break in structural integrity).

    **`Avoid fixing LED light sticks using wires and thin strings/threads. Use regular old, reliable gaffer tape instead. Do not use paper tape! You don't need the risk of a fire.`**

- **`Use location lights to your advantage (especially if you are short on gear and time).`**

    Remember to try and test out the lighting setup already on location during a light study. Some locations might have some great lighting setups already installed.

- **`Make sure you have a good rest before the job.`**
  
  Make plans that include SLEEP! An hour of sleep a day is not a viable strategy!

- **`Mask the tape against the background.`** Have at least black and white gaffer tapes with you. Ideally, have grey gaffer tape in your pack as well.

### Good

- **`Do a proper light study of the area you are going to light.`** See the place as it is lit by natural light at the exact time of an event beforehand.

- **`Don't trip any breaks!`** Inquire about and verify the power capabilities of the locations you're about to light. You will save yourself, your crew and the owner a headache. Additionally, you won't risk damaging any of the equipment.

- **`Take location light reference photos.`** Get some reference material to look at and plan a light set up later on. Save mental space and don't miss out on any key information. Human memory is flawed!

- **`Take reference photos of your finished work.`** Remember what worked and what didn't for long. Have some material to show to potential clients. Own your hard work and success.

## 5. `"???"` | Film set (08.09.2023)

- **`Make sure you know the shooting day shedule`**

## 6. `"48HFP 2023"` | Film set (29.09.2023 - 01.10.2023)

**ROLE:** 1'st AC

### Result: [Mała usterka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5za44jA67w)

### Bad

- **`Make time to sleep`**

Even a few hours (> 2h) will alow you to function better and faster.

- **`Match your film concept with the time limit`**

Don't waste time trying to fit a larger story into a 10 min format. Come up with another story - a shorter one, one that can be told in it's entiryty in your fixed timeframe.

- **`Mach shoes to environment and weather`**

Sneakers will only work in a heavily urban environment.
For non urban (suburban and rural) locations use waterproof shoes with ancle support - heat insulation, mud resistance and protection from additional strain while carrying the equipement.

### Good

- **`Carry multitools and basic filmmaking gear on your person at all times`**

    When working on set (be it a profesional or a student one) make sure your equipement includes:

  - **duct tape** - at least black and gray
  - **multitool**
  - **allen wrench set**
  - **microfiber wipe** - for camera lenses
  - **zip ties** (cable ties)
  - **insulating tape** - in case of cable damage
  - **headlamp** (a flashlight mounted on your forhead - leaves two hands operational) - shoots have the tendency to run late
  - **fingerless gloves** (do not affect dexterity while providing heat insulation, prventing prints and friction burns)
  - **spring clamps** (varius sizes) - quite usefull

- **`Production manager - a key role for successfull shoot`**

While shooting a film a key role on set is a production manager. They keep the shooting shedule in check and everybody moving in their respective fields.

- **`Quickly finding an emotional core of the story`**

Brainstorming is a suprisingly effective, inclusive and efficient method for generating ideas and gathering authentic human experiences related to the film's subjectmatter. Let everybody in the writer's room share their experiences on the films core theme.

- **`Write a backup script`**

In case problems with the primary idea fail to be resolved by morning (shooting time), your team will still be able to organize around and shoot the less interesting, but non the less **complete** story.
