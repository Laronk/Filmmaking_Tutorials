# Lessons from my past projects

## 0. `---` | MINE AGH Challenge: "Colors"

### Result: [Project did not conclude](./Lessons_from_past_filmmaking_projects__Jan_Karpiuk.md)

### Bad

- **`ASK FOR HELP`**

    People are more helpfull than you think. Nobody's out to steal your idea. It is shitty anyway. **Nothing worst than you not making your idea a reality can happen!**

- **`KNOW YOUR EQUIPEMENT`**

    Check what equipement you have avaliable for your shoot. Have someone more experienced walk you through the purpose, and use of every piece of equipement. **Take notes.**

    **Do not presume you will figure the equipment out during the shoot! you will most likely not!**
  
### Good

- **`RESEARCH SHOTS YOU WANT TO MAKE`**

    Know how to achieve the types of shots, shooting a specific subject, you want in your footage. There is a lot of reference material and tutorials out there. **Learn from others.**

## 1. `"FENIX MATCHES"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "Advertisement"

### Result: [FENIX MATCHES | Advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67lx43Paau8)

### Bad

- **`NO LIGHT - NO FILM`**

    Shooting in the dark REQUIRES a camera made for that purpose. Othervise prepare for a lot of noise in your video!

    Some noise is acceptable, to much and no denoisifier software will be able to help your ass!
    Oh, you want to shoot in complete darkness, hmmm...? Go infrared, idiot.
    **Film is painting with light. No light - No painting.**

- **`MIND THE DANGERS OF THE LOCATION`**

    Think about where you are shooting, and the dangers it presents to you, your crew, and the equipment.

    Do not shoot on public or private roads at night, without any lights. You will get run over ba a vehicle.

### Good

- **`LEARN FROM MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE`**
  
    Have a more experienced person handle the stuff you can not yet do. **Save time during the shoot** and **learn from others**.

- **`GET EQUIPMENT RIGHT FOR YOUR NEEDS`**

    **Plan your shots with the right equipement in mind.**

    If your subject is a danger to you or the equipment (like fire), it might be a good idea to keep your distance and use a narrow lense.

- **`DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT`**

    If you have reached your best or run out of time, and you still think the video looks bad... Show it to others, more experienced people anyway. **At least you finished something!**

## 2. `"(A)SYMMETRY"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "(a)symmetry"

### Result: [(A)SYMMETRY | Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE9tMI3Jd1k)

### Bad

- **`LIGHTING SUBJECT WITH DIFERENT TEMPERATURE LIGHTS - PAIN IN COLOR CORRECTION`**
  
    You will have to dynamicly colorcorrect your footage, when lighting your subject with lightsources of different temperatures in a single shot. **Save yourself and your colorist the trouble!**

- **`YOU CAN CORRECT LENSE WARP IN POST`**
  
    It is possible! **No straight walls bending at the frame edge.** It is fine if that's you'r vission tho...

- **`MINIMAL FILM CREW - 2 PEAOPLE`**

    Friends make life easier! **There will come unexpected, on location problems whitch can't be solved on your own!** Save time and learn to colaborate with others.

### Good

- **`MAKE A PREVIZ VIDEO`**

    **Test the idea before you commit to it.** Shoot it even with your shitty phone camera. You will see how you can improve uppon the initial concept.

- **`HAVE A WHITE SURFACE IN EVERY SHOT FOR LIGHT TEMPERATURE REFERENCE`**

    Help yourself in postproduction. I know, tedious extra few seconds in every shot... You will thank yourself later. Trust me, it is worth it.

## 3. `"PAPER MAILMAN"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "Water"

### Result: [PAPER MAILMAN | Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtCTOG7gCSQ)

### Bad

- **`VIDEO EDIT IS ONLY =< 30% OF THE POST WORKLOAD`**

    **Don't plan your postproduction shedule thinking that edited fottage is basicly a done film.** you need time for coloring, sound design and eventual VFX/CGI.

- **`HAVE A SHOTLIST READY ON LOCATION`**

    **Save time on location. Keep track of shooting progress. Prioritize key shots.** You can always experiment and search for extra shots when you finish the main ones.

- **`BRING BASIC DRAWING SUPPLIES ON SET`**

    A pencil will not get wet or stop working + you can erase it. In fact bring a whole pencilcase. You never know when you will need some basic drawing supplies.

- **`MAKE NOTES ON DONE TAKES`**

    Save time in postproduction searching for the right takes.

- **`PLAN YOUR SHOTS WITH THE EDITING IN MIND`**

    It is not enough to have a story and shots planed out. You need to know how the shots will connect in the editing. **Know transitions between individual shots and scenes.**

- **`LONGER FOCAL LENGTH - MORE STABILIZATION NEDED`.**

    For **shots with a narrower lense use more stabilization** than a shoulder rig. A tripod or at least a gyro-stabilizer is in order.

- **`TAKE A SNACK ON SET`**

    You are a living being. You need sustenance! **Your head will hurt if you do not eat!**

### Good

- **`SCOUT THE LOCATION FOR POSSIBLE SHOTS`**

    **Take lots of pictures!** If your shoot is more elaborate and needs to tell a coherent story go to the location at least twice. It will help you come up with the shots. It will also **save time during the shooting**.

- **You can `incorporate the white surface for referencing light temperature into your subject's design.` Have it always visible in your shots.**

    NO NEED TO WASTE TIME ON LOCATION.

- **If you have any `extra batteries avaliable, even partialy charged, and wondering if you should take them... Take those batteries!!!`**

    TAKE EVERY SPARE BATTERY YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON!!! TAKE A CHARGER TOO, IF YOU CAN.

- **`Shoot some b-roll footage in between main shots.` You never know when you might need a cutaway in editing!**

    B-ROLL IS A SAFETY NET FOR YOUR SHITTY OR MISSING MAIN SHOTS. TAKE CARE TO HAVE SOME.

- **`B-roll makes great material for location establishing shots` (not only wide shots, but close-ups as well - Sometimes less is more).**

    B-ROLL IS EASY TO SHOOT. YOU CAN MAKE LOTS OF IT. SOME IS BOUND TO BE USEFULL.

- **`Mark shots that are requred for your story to make sence` in your shotlist. `Shoot these first.`**

    THE MAIN STORY SHOTS TAKE PRIORITY OVER THE PREETTY ONES!

- **If you are `shooting in multiple locations` (even locations close by), `plan the shoot beforehand!`**

    SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF TIME AND PHYSICAL LABOUR ON LOCATION!

- **`Diversify lighting and shadows on your subject` using shadows cast by existing obstacles. Position the subject half in the shadows. Seek out buildings, spaces under bridges, large trees.**

    MAKE YOUR ENVIRONMENT WORK FOR YOU

## 4. `"HIDING PLACE"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "HORROR"

### Result: [PAPER MAILMAN | Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtCTOG7gCSQ)

### Bad

- color temp.
- too little light (it's easier to make the footage darker in post than to remove ridiculus ammounts of noise)

- Invest in an interesting costumes for the actors. It might just be a single piece of clothing.

## 5. `"PULP NOIR"` | MINE AGH Challenge: ""

### Result: [PULP NOIR | Short Film](./Lessons_from_past_filmmaking_projects__Jan_Karpiuk.md)

### Bad

- no sleep
- explain your vision to the production manager (they can double check you on set)
- incomplete prep - UV lipstick was not tested
- create the background first, then match lighting in the studio to the background (or use relight Resolve Capability)
- test reading - estimate film runtime, some dilogue only looks good on paper
-

### Good

- brake for pizza (time to reflect on work done so far)
- go over the plot, character's backstory and motivation with actors
- let actors perform their interpretations of the characters on the first take (if there is time for it) - you might get some interesting insight into the characters
- get feedback on the screenplay from as many people as you possibly can
- understand your true role as a director **on set** - keep actors' emotions in check and dialogue on track
- trust your team, filmmaking is a collaboration -
