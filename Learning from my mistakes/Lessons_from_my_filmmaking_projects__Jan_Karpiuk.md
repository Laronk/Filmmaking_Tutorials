    People are more helpfull than you think. Nobody's out to steal your idea. It is shitty anyway. **Nothing worst than you not making your idea a reality can happen!**

- **`KNOW YOUR EQUIPEMENT`**

    Check what equipement you have avaliable for your shoot. Have someone more experienced walk you through the purpose, and use of every piece of equipement. **Take notes.**

### Good

- **`RESEARCH SHOTS YOU WANT TO MAKE`**

## 1. `"FENIX MATCHES"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "Advertisement"

### Result: [FENIX MATCHES | Advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67lx43Paau8)

### Bad

- **`NO LIGHT - NO FILM`**

    Shooting in the dark REQUIRES a camera made for that purpose. Othervise prepare for a lot of noise in your video!

    Some noise is acceptable, to much and no denoisifier software will be able to help your ass!
    Oh, you want to shoot in complete darkness, hmmm...? Go infrared, idiot.
    **Film is painting with light. No light - No painting.**

- **`MIND THE DANGERS OF THE LOCATION`**

    Think about where you are shooting, and the dangers it presents to you, your crew, and the equipment.

    Do not shoot on public or private roads at night, without any lights. You will get run over ba a vehicle.

### Good

- **`LEARN FROM MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE`**
  
    Have a more experienced person handle the stuff you can not yet do. **Save time during the shoot** and **learn from others**.

- **`GET EQUIPMENT RIGHT FOR YOUR NEEDS`**

    **Plan your shots with the right equipement in mind.**

    If your subject is a danger to you or the equipment (like fire), it might be a good idea to keep your distance and use a narrow lense.

- **`DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT`**

    If you have reached your best or run out of time, and you still think the video looks bad... Show it to others, more experienced people anyway. **At least you finished something!**

## 2. `"(A)SYMMETRY"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "(a)symmetry"

### Result: [(A)SYMMETRY | Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE9tMI3Jd1k)

### Bad

    **Test the idea before you commit to it.** Shoot it even with your shitty phone camera. You will see how you can improve uppon the initial concept.

- **`HAVE A WHITE SURFACE IN EVERY SHOT FOR LIGHT TEMPERATURE REFERENCE`**

    Help yourself in postproduction. I know, tedious extra few seconds in every shot... You will thank yourself later. Trust me, it is worth it.

## 3. `"PAPER MAILMAN"` | MINE AGH Challenge: "Water"

### Result: [PAPER MAILMAN | Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtCTOG7gCSQ)

### Bad

- **`VIDEO EDIT IS ONLY =< 30% OF THE POST WORKLOAD`**

    **Don't plan your postproduction shedule thinking that edited fottage is basicly a done film.** you need time for coloring, sound design and eventual VFX/CGI.

    **Save time on location. Keep track of shooting progress. Prioritize key shots.** You can always experiment and search for extra shots when you finish the main ones.

- **`BRING BASIC DRAWING SUPPLIES ON SET`**

    A pencil will not get wet or stop working + you can erase it. In fact bring a whole pencilcase. You never know when you will need some basic drawing supplies.

- **`MAKE NOTES ON DONE TAKES`**

    Save time in postproduction searching for the right takes.

- **`PLAN YOUR SHOTS WITH THE EDITING IN MIND`**

    It is not enough to have a story and shots planed out. You need to know how the shots will connect in the editing. **Know transitions between individual shots and scenes.**

- **`LONGER FOCAL LENGTH - MORE STABILIZATION NEDED`.**

    For **shots with a narrower lense use more stabilization** than a shoulder rig. A tripod or at least a gyro-stabilizer is in order.

- **`TAKE A SNACK ON SET`**

    You are a living being. You need sustenance! **Your head will hurt if you do not eat!**

### Good

- **`SCOUT THE LOCATION FOR POSSIBLE SHOTS`**

    **Take lots of pictures!** If your shoot is more elaborate and needs to tell a coherent story go to the location at least twice. It will help you come up with the shots. It will also **save time during the shooting**.

- **`INCORPORATE THE LIGHT TEMPERATURE WHITE SURFACE INTO YOUR SUBJECT'S DESIGN`**

    Have it always visible in your shots. **No need to waste time on location** for showing a white pice of paper for the camera.

    If you have any extra batteries avaliable, even partialy charged take them... Take every spare battery you can get your hands on!!! **Take a charger too, if you can.**

- **`SHOOT B-ROLL FOOTAGE`**

    B-roll is **a safety net for editing** your shitty or missing main shots. Take care to have some. You never know when you might need a cutaway in editing.

- **`B-roll makes great material for location establishing shots` (not only wide shots, but close-ups as well - Sometimes less is more).**

    B-ROLL IS EASY TO SHOOT. YOU CAN MAKE LOTS OF IT. SOME IS BOUND TO BE USEFULL.

- **`PRIORITIZE MAIN SHOTS`**

    Mark shots that are requred for your story to make sence in your shotlist. Shoot these first. **The main story shots take priority over the preetty ones!**

- **`PLAN THE SHOOTING SHEDULE BEFOREHAND`**

    If you are shooting in multiple locations or even locations close by plan the shoot route earlier **Minimize the need to move equipement and people around.**

- **`MAKE YOUR ENVIRONMENT WORK FOR YOU - DIVERSIFY LIGHTING`**

    **Use shadows cast by existing obstacles.** Create diverse and interesting lighting for your subjects. Position the subject half in the shadows. Seek out buildings, spaces under bridges, large trees.

### Result: [PAPER MAILMAN | Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtCTOG7gCSQ)

### Bad

- **`KNOW THE COLOR TEMPERATURE OF YOUR LIGHTS`**

    Even RAW file format wont help you in postroduction color correction if the initial color temperature is way off.

- **`EXPOSE CORRECTLY - MAKE SHADOWS DARKER IN POST`**
  
  Too little light - badly esposed image will be verry noisy. It's easier and faster to make the footage darker in post than to remove ridiculus ammounts of noise from it. **You need a lot of light even for the scenes happening in complete darkness.**

### Good

- **`CHARACTERS "POP" WITH COSTUMES`**
  
  Invest in interesting costumes for the actors. It might just be a single piece of clothing. **Character's need custom clothing to comunicate their personalities and predicaments.**

- **`TEST ALL VFX BEFOREHAND`**
  
  Incomplete preparations with visual effects might cause problems in postproduction. Save yourself time and trouble.
  
- **`COMPOSITING GREENSCREEN - BACKGROUND FIRST`**
  
  When you don't have resources or time to create virtual environments for the scenes **start from shoothing the background.** This will provide you with lighting reference that can be recreated in shooting studio / sound stage. The final greenscreen composite will have consistant lighting across background and subjects. (Liferaft - relight Resolve Capability, bu takes a long time and a lot of processing power)

### Good

  Yor true **role as a director on set is to keep actors' emotions in check and dialogue on track.** Make sure you are getting the performance you want. **Trust (but verify) your crew**- give people responsibilities: audio, camera and lighting if you can. You are only a single person, wearing multiple hats might overwhelm you and cause you to miss something important.

- **`AS A DIRECTOR - UNDERSTAND HOW TO APPROACH WITH DIRECTING EACH ACTOR`**

    Actors, depending on their experience level and working method, will need different style of directing, differently defined feedback. Make sure to know what each of your actors wants from you.

### Good

- **`SELECT AND TRUST YOUR CREW`**

- **`SCREENWRITING - LOCATION FIRST APPROACH`**

    Use all the specific quirks and features of the location to your advantage. Create a compelling story where the location plays a key role.

- **`WHEN WRITING A SCRIPT FOCUS SOLELY ON ENTERTAINING AND NOT CONFUSING THE READER`**

    Your script needs to read well - like an interesting article or a fun short story. Do not focus on the filmmaking aspects when screenwriting. Instead, focus on characters, emotions and the story you want to tell.

- **`VALUE THE ART OVER GEAR`**

    A steady shot might not fit the story/character emotional state as well as a more primitive/chaotic shaky handheld shot. Just because you finally have access to cool and expensive gear does not mean you should use it.
