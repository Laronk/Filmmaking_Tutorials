* Theme: "Search for identity. Who was I? Do I really want to know who I was?"

## 3. **Set up `[1-10]`**

Jason is on his way to a bank in Zurich.

He is pure intuition at this point.

A flaw is introduced: **he is overly aggresive**. (Puts two police officers in hospital, just because he felt slightly threatened by them).

He is esentaily a "loaded weapon with a broken trigger". He will have to learn how to controll he's intuition.

We see that Json is extremely confused by he's new found abilities.Frightened even.

## 4. **Catalyst `[12]`**

Jason and Marrie visit Mr. Bourne's house in parris.
Action, action, car chase, emotional moment for both characters. Marrie decides to stick by Bourne until he figures out who he is.

## 14. **Finale `[85-110]`**

Jason, now fully ready (aware of his unique skillset), faces he's opponents.
