# Action writing tips

## Write Your Screenplay Podcast: ["Writing the Action Movie: How "Amazing" is SPIDERMAN 2"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZUjQB6KChapRUN4IOhB5b)

1. Convey story beats, `plot and character development through action`

2. `"Prime the audience"` for your action sequence (make them anxious with anticipation)

    This will ensure the audience receives the action as you intended (primed them for - either serious or funny)

3. `Make each action sequence unique` and different from the rest in the movie:

    Use chases, escapes, heists, robberies, captures, breakins, thefts, espionage, confrontations (direct fights, engagements). Just don't have exactly the same stuff twice in one movie.

4. `Use action to move story forward`

    Use yor action scenes to further the plot and character dvevelopment. Don't waste your action scenes.

5. `Hit your heroes hard!` Don't pull any punches.

    Your heroes need the hardest obstacles and fights they can get. The stakes are not high enough otherwise.
