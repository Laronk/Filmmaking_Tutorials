# Dialogue

There seem to be many approaches to writing good dialogue. Some more academic, some more stylistic and some just realistic.

* Three Questions (David Mamet method):

    1. Who wants what from who?
    2. What happens if they don't get it?
    3. Why now?

* Jerry B. Jenkins method:

    1. Cut dialogue to the bone.
    2. Use dialogue to reveal backstory.
    3. Use dialogue to reveal character.
    4. Be subtle. (subtext, sidestepping, silence)

    5. Read your dialogue aloud.
    6. Create a 'Make My Day' moment.

## Make your dialogue quotable

* make your characters quote the dialogue multiple times in different ways and circumstances (audience will want to join in on the fun)
* the story has to already be good, quotability wont make your dialogue fun on its own. It can only elevate it once you've already put in the good work.
