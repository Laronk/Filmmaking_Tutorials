# Save the cat - Story beats

Since Snyder’s sheet was originally created for screenwriting, the bracketed number by each beat is the page or pages that it would take up of a standard **110-page screenplay**. The beats are as follows:

## 1. **Opening Image `[1]`**

### An opening snapshot

* This is a snapshot that instantly introduces us to the present world of the hero. (Can establish an overarching message)

  **Example: `"Interstellar"`**

  !["Opening Image"](./images/opening_image.png "Opening Image")

  !["Opening Image Explained"](./images/opening_image_explained.png "Opening Image Explained")

  A model space shuttle sitting on a bookshelf edge. Books, shelf and the model covered in brown dust. Dust particles in the air visibly inluminated by a nearby window.

  Dorment immage for:

  * hope (Humanity escaping doom/extinction into space),
  * personal forlorne desire (Cooper's and Humanity's dreams of space exploration)  

      Counterpoint to the finall image.

## 2. **Theme Stated `[5]`**

### We are introduced to the central theme or lesson of the story

* This beat introduces the central idea, or life lesson, that the hero will discover over the course of the story.

  **Example: `"Interstellar"`**

  !["Theme Stated Explained"](./images/theme_stated_explained.png "Theme Stated Explained")

  * Murph states: **"You said science was bout admitting what we don't know."**

  * Cooper is presented as a strict scientific mind. **Will he be able to accept a non-scientific method as a solution to a problem?** (even when it comes preventing human extinction)

---

## 3. **Set Up `[1-10]`**

### The hero and the 'ordinary world' are introduced

* Here comes a deeper, more detailed look at the status quo of the hero’s world, before it is violently shaken up. Crucial details about the **character flaws** they might be working to overcome will show up here too.

* We meet our hero and see why we should root for them (**save the cat moment**).
* Hero's world is established: challanges both external (environment / wants) and internal (falws / needs).


  **Example: `"Interstellar"`**

  !["Set Up Explained"](./images/set_up_explained.png "Set Up Explained")

  * External:

    * **Earth is crisis** (dust storms, crops dying out)
    * Earth on verge of famine -> more farmers needed -> **Cooper's son will not be going to college**

  * Internal:

    * Cooper's absolute belief in science -> want's to save his children's future with the help of science

  * **"Save the cat"** for Cooper: want to fight for his kids' better future

---

## 4. **Catalyst `[12]`**

### Something happens that sets the story in motion

* Also known as the **inciting incident** in other structures, this major plot pointis the single moment that sets the hero on the course they will pursue over the story.

  **Example: `"Interstellar"`**

  !["Catalyst Explained"](./images/catalyst_explained.png "Catalyst Explained")

## 5. **Debate `[12-25]`**

### The hero is hesitant to take action

* Following the catalyst, the hero resists the challenge presented by the inciting incident.

  **Example: `"Interstellar"`**

---

## 6. **Break Into Two `[25]`**

---

## 7. **B Story `[30]`**

### The subplot kicks in, introducing a character who helps the hero in their transformation

* The B story, or subplot, is introduced fairly early and continues to run alongside the main plot for most of its duration. The B story usually involves a character (romantic interest / mentor / foil) who’s integral to helping the hero undergo their transformation.

## 8. **Fun and Games `[30-55]`**

### The hero in the throes of their challenge or journey

* Despite the label, this beat might not actually entail any fun for the characters involved, and is also often referred to as the **‘promise of the premise’**. Here is where that action or central conflict that was promised, often in the hook of the story description, is delivered on.

* Hero explores the world.

* In a superhero story, this is where we get to see them beat up some low-level bad guys; in a detective story, **'fun and games'** is where the gumshoe will start tracking down some clues.

  **Example: `"Interstellar"`**

  !["Fun and Games Explained"](./images/fun_and_games_explained.png "Fun and Games Explained")

---

## 9. **Midpoint `[55]`**

### The stakes are raised

* This point signals the culmination of the action of the ‘fun and games’. Stakes are raised by a plot twist that likely takes the form of a false victory — a moment where the hero mistakenly believes they have won

* Point of no return. False victory or false defeat.

  **Example: `"Interstellar"`**

  * Point of no return.
  * Cooper nearly escapes death. He comes back on Endurace finding the time diolation costed him 22 year of his chilred's life. They are all grow up now.

### The hero realizes a truth that’s been evading them all this time
