## D4Darious: ["How To Direct Actors: Working With Non Actors"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjBzv0Mcdw0)

---

### 1. `WHAT YOU CAST IS WHAT YOU GET`

* New actors have verry limited range
* Cast for look and personality type and traits that you need

### 2. `COMMUNICATION IS KEY`

* New actors are unfamiliar with filmmaking jargon or process
* Make actors feel comfortable by comunitating with them - walk them through scenes, explain what marks are and how to hit them, explain frame lines for closeups

### 3. `REHERSAL TIME`

* The more you reherse, the better
* Make sure actors understand their lines, their motivations and their goals

### 4. `MINIMIZE LINGO`

* Speak to your new actors in layman's terms

### 5. `FIRST FEW TAKES`

* Expect the first few takes might be the best ones

### 6. `DIFICULTY WITH LINES`

* Be ready to abandon your script (don't be precious about it) if actors are having trouble with their lines
* Get more natural performance bby allowing actors to phrase their lines themselves

### 7. `MANIPULATE THE ENVIRONMENT`

* Make the action require actors to react, not act
* Example: Use real phones and make actual phonecalls, make actors do jumping jacks for scenes with physical exaustion, weigh their props down so they don't have to act out the weight

### 8. `SHOW THEM WHAT YOU WANT`

* What does not work with experienced actors might actualy work with fresh ones
* Do it yourself, show them exactly what you want. It might be quicker and more precise than any description.
