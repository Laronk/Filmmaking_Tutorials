### 1. "Preburn" your new and/or long not used lights

Any light that can get extremely hot will produce some fumes or start to smell. This might be simply dust buildup burning off, but the fumes might be sufficient to set of smoke detectors on location.

Before using your light on location run them for a couple of hours (~8h) to burn off any fumes producing residue on them. Make sure to box up the barn doors (NOT ENTIRELY CLOSED!) to heat their surfaces as well.
