# CONTRIBUTING

You wont to contribute somethig to my notes? That's amazing :)

## How to contribute

I realy don't think anybody will be interested in that, but just as a contingency...

Message me throught any means necesary (most apropriate would be email, I think, but anything goes realy). I'll provide you with correct access rights to the repository.

I reserve the right to validate any submitions before merging them to the core notes ('main' branch at the moment).
