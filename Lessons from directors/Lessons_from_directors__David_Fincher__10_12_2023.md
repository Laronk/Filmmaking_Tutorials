### 1. `DIRECTING A MOVIE IS LIKE A THREE DIMENSIONAL CHESS, EVERYBODY HAS TO PEAK AT THE SAME TIME`

* There are so many variables in the movie making process
* Everybody has to do their best (the crew and the actors) at the same time
* The best version of the story should mandate how the scene gets cut (demand good work from everybody on set all the time)
* The story is only as good as the weakest performance in it

### 2. `WRITE YOUR SCREENPLAY AS VISUALLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THE IMAGES WILL STAY IN THE READERS' MINDS FOR A LONG TIME`

* Focus solely on the script you are writing/reading, use your imagination
* Remember the first time experience you had reading the script, know what grabbed your attention

### 3. `ASK FOR AS MANY TAKES YOU NEED. IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT THE ACTOR, THAT’S THE FOCUS, BUT IT’S A BALLET BETWEEN SO MANY PEOPLE`

* How many takes can I ask for from the actors? Ask for as many as you need. Keep everybody's work in mind, not just the actors. 

### 4. `IT’S ABOUT TASTE. IT’S NOT ABOUT EQUIPMENT. YOU CAN MAKE A COMPLETE FILM JUST WITH YOUR IPAD, YOU CAN WRITE ON IT, FILM WITH IT AND EDIT WITH IT.`

* An iPad is sufficient equipment for writing, collaborating on, shooting and editing the film. There is no excuse for not starting to make movies in lack of professional equipment.

### 5. `IF YOU TRULY WANT TO GET THE RIGHTS FOR A CERTAIN BOOK, THEN COME UP WITH A COMPLETE PLAN, WITH ACTORS, STORYBOARDS, BUDGET, SCHEDULE AND A SCRIPT.`

* Have a plan for making a movie to present to the producers and script/book owners. (schedule, budget, cast, script, storyboards)
* Plan versions of the movie for several budgets.

### 6. `WITH EVERY COLLABORATOR, FROM AN ART DESIGNER TO A COMPOSER YOU ARE TRYING TO DO ONE KEY THING, WHICH IS TO MAKE STRANGERS FEEL SOMETHING`

* Movie making is trying to make strangers feel something at the same time.
* Your movie is supposed to evoke a specific emotion. People watch your movie to feel a certain way.

### 7. `“IT’S MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY.” WHETHER IT’S FOR REAL OR WHETHER IT’S FAKE ON THE SET YOU GOT TO PROJECT CONFIDENCE.`

* It takes about ~10~15 years to develop the confidence needed for commanding a film crew. Fake it until you get there.
* People do not want to be lead by an uncertain person.

### 8. `THE OLD RULES OF STORYTELLING DON’T NECESSARILY APPLY IN THE 21ST CENTURY,  SO FIND NEW AND UNPREDICTABLE WAYS TO TELL STORIES`

* Make your stories unpredictable yet coherent.
* Do not be tied to the old ways of storytelling adapted by film from different art forms.

### 9. `PREPARE FOR THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG ON THE SET, BUT AT THE SAME TIME LEAVE THE ROOM FOR CREATIVITY SO IT DOESN'T BECOME JUST A BORING EXECUTION.`

* Make room for creativity, by making the process a communal experience - take other people ideas into account. Make a movie together.

### 10. `DO THE BEST AS YOU CAN, BUT BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY CAREERS AND FACTORS IN THE PROCESS THAT WHEN A MOVIE REALLY WORKS IT IS USUALLY THE RESULT OF LUCK.`
