## Outstanding Screenplays: ["10 Screenwriting Tips from Quentin Tarantino on how he wrote Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSpqFn5TRCk)

---

### 1. `DEVELOP YOUR OWN WRITING PROCESS THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY`

* Quentin's first approach

    Writing in caffes. Writing at night. Making breaks to listen to music.

* Quentin's second approach (since "Inglorious Bastards")

    Writing during the day (start 10-11, stop 17-18). Unwind time. Critical thinking in a pool (place of physical relaxation) - taking notes on new ideas. Next day work is the previous day's notes.

    Process summarized:

  * Develop on your screenplay during the day in regular work hours 
  * Take a break to unwind
  * Think criticly about your work
  * Take notes - todays thoughts are the tomorrow's work

### 2. `DON'T CONFUSE THE AUDIENCE`

...by mistake

Confusion severs the audience emotional link with your movie.

Momentarly confusing the audience is allowed if done on purpouse.

### 3. `REWRITE OTHER SCENES AND FILL IN THE BLANKS`

* Quentin's original way to practice writing dialogue

    Watch movies, and try to write the scenes form memory after.
    It's inevitable for you to eventualy fill in the blank spots in your memory with our original dialogue. 

### 4. `TAKE THE OLDEST STORIES IS THE BOOK AND REINVENT THEM`

Take old stories and write a screenplay abut a part in them that has never been focused upon in the history of cinema. Steel stuff butm make it your own!

### 5. `TAKE MORALITY OUT OF THE QUESTION TO HAVE INTERESTING HARACTERS`

"Light"/half-villans make for move interesting protagonists.
Let your characters be who they are like in a novel.

### 6. `WRITE THE MOVIE YOU WANT TO SEE`

Write a story you want to witness. Give it the esthetic you like. If you can enjoy watching you rown movie, so can the audience.

### 7. `DO YOUR SUBTEXT WORK`

SUBTEXT WORK - The job of a Director.
As a Director you need to understand the subtext of your sotory and individual scenes in it. "Deservoir Dogs" is a gangster-robery story, but it's subtext is a father-son story of Mr. White and Mr. Orange.  

### 8. `GIVE YOUR CHARACTERS MORAL CHOICES`

... and punish/reward them for it. You can punish immoral behavior with ironic twists of fate, or reward selfless moral deeds with uexpected niceties, or even do the opposite if you can pull it off...

### 9. `WRITE EXTENSIVE CHARACTER BACKSTORIES TO GET BEST ACTORS`

Write extensive character descriptions and bacstories, expecialy if your character has little screen time and dialogue scenes. Give your actors material to convey the characters backstory through shere bodylanguage/presence alone.

### 10. `LOVE WHAT YOU DO`

(TRUST YOUR LOVE FOR THE CINEMA, THE MEDIUM, THE ARTS - FIMS ARE MADE BY PASSIONATE MORTALS, LIKE YOURSELF - PASSION MAKES GREAT WORK)
