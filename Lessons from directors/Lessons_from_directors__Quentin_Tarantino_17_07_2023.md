## Outstanding Screenplays: ["10 Screenwriting Tips from Quentin Tarantino on how he wrote Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSpqFn5TRCk)

---

### 1. `DEVELOP YOUR OWN WRITING PROCESS THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY`

* Quentin's first approach

    Writing in caffes. Writing at night. Making breaks to listen to music.

* Second approach (since "Inglorious Bastards")

    Writing during the day (start 10-11, stop 17-18). Unwind time. Critical thinking in a pool (place of physical relaxation) - taking notes on new ideas. Next day work is the previous day's notes.

    Process summarized:

  * Write your screenplay
  * Take a break to unwind
  * Think criticly about the your work
  * Note the work for tomorrow

### 2. `DON'T CONFUSE THE AUDIENCE`

### 3. `REWRITE OTHER SCENES AND FILL IN THE BLANKS`

### 4. `TAKE THE OLDEST STORIES IS THE BOOK AND REINVENT THEM`

### 5. `TAKE MORALITY OUT OF THE QUESTION TO HAVE INTERESTING HARACTERS`

### 6. `WRITE THE MOVIE YOU WANT TO SEE`

### 7. `DO YOUR SUBTEXT WORK`

SUBTEXT - The job of a Director

### 8. `GIVE YOUR CHARACTERS MORAL CHOICES`

... and punish/reward them for it.

### 9. `WRITE EXTENSIVE CHARACTER BACKSTORIES TO GET BEST ACTORS`

### 10. `LOVE WHAT YOU DO`

(TRUST YOUR LOVE FOR THE CINEMA, THE MEDIUM, THE ARTS - FIMS ARE MADE BY PASSIONATE MORTALS, LIKE YOURSELF - PASSION MAKES GREAT WORK)
