## **Wse Anderson's idea of writing and directing movies**

"I do feel kind of like I've got my owm style and voide.

There's a rhythm that's not quite reality.

Old-fashioned movie techniques... tone

It's hard wiring that I'm not really able to reconfigure.

**I don't mind terribly building up a collection of films taht are linked together, but I would love not to have someone say: 'Well that's just like what you did before.'**"
~ Wes Anderson

### 1. **Pull from your past**

"Without me controlling it or choosing to, im in the movies..." ~ Wes Anderson

Recognize the things yuo like in movies and develop your uinque style pulling from your personal experiences. This should happen naturaly when you create something of course.

"(...) I think I would rather just do what I love."  ~ Wes Anderson

### 2. **Build a world**

Sets and costumes can be jokes in of themselves with slight exaggeration woven into the designs.

### 3. **Precission and symmetry**

"A lot of things that I do the same way every time, but it's just the way I like it." ~ Wes Anderson

Symmertical frames - almost a visual watermark of Wes's work

"I feel always feel like any character from any one of my movies could walk into another one of the movies and be at home there." ~ Wes Anderson

"(Interviewer) Do you ever want to do something that is dramatically different from anything you've ever done? 

(Wes Anderson) Yeah, I do."

Don't fear doing new things, expreimenting. Don't stagnate! Be open to new experiences.

### 4. **Find your spark**

Have an idea for a film. It has to come from somewere. Base film on some dream, fantasy, book, etc.

Do a lot of research, a lot!

Immerse yourself in picteres, culture, movies that you are aiming for in your project. Put pictures on your walls. Watch reference movies etc.
Put in the work into research.

### 5. **Just go shoot**

When you are starting just do a movie you have the budget for. Bigger projects will come, have patience. Prove to yourself that you can do something on a smaller scale, but on a proffesional level.

Just do it! Write a movie and go shoot it with whomever you have avaliable.

Try to show the movie to as much people as possible. Submit it to movie festivals. Give yourself the chance to be recognized!
