---

### 1. `DO SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IN, RATHER THAN WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT`

* Be true to your own passion and what exicetes you as a storyteller.
* Stick to your guns, to the things that you can do the others can not.

### 2. `FIGURE OUT WHAT IS INTERESTING TO YOU AND PRESENT IT IN A WAY THAT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO THE AUDIENCE`

* You can find a genre that already has an audience attached to it (like a crime genre / spy thrillers / noir films) and convey the things you find interesting through that storytelling structure. The genre monster will be fed and you will have toled your story.

### 3. `ADD MULTIPLE LAYERS`

Make your stories withsand multiple viewings. The story has to be layered narratively, have some ambiguity to allow for new insite with every rewatch. Make your story a rewarding, complex puzzle for the viewer - make them work out the puzzle details during subsequent rewatches.

You can also choose to have rich, dence visuals that take multiple viewings to deconstruct compeletely.

### 4. `APPROACH STRUCTURE MATHEMATICALLY WITH DIAGRAMS`

A well drawn/planned diagram of your story will reveal the building tensions throught your movie.  
You can use a music trick in your score called "Shepard's tone" - an inlussion of contious uwards scaling tones can mirror tension rising beyond hypothetical limits.
Apply this principle to your scenes and make tension/stakes get higher and higher as the movie progresses.

### 5. `START BY YOURSELF AS SOON AS YOU CAN, GROW YOUR PROJECTS AND NEVER STOP`

That's it. Just start and increase your project complexities with each one.

### 6. `MAKE A FILM YOU WOULD WANT TO SEE YOURSELF`

You will feel like you are working for yourself and have the right attitude towards the movie your making. Trust yourself as an audience member for your film.

### 7. `LEARN A LITTLE BIT OF ALL ASPECTS OF FILMMAKING`

Be willing to perform evey task the film crew has to do. Know the jobs of your crew, show interest, and know what you want from your collaborators. Get insight into film ste jobs. This will help you on bigger projects. It's part of your job as a director to know how to speak to different departments about thieir aspect of the movie you are making (be it lighting, camera, actors, audio, set design... etc.)

### 8. `WRITE ABOUT WHAT INSPIRES YOU`

Be true to yourself about what facinates/inspires you and write about that. Make the film a conversation about the topics that interst you.

### 9. `Have a new project ready for when you are asked what you want to do next`

While ending work on one project develop a new idea for the next movie. Always have the next project/projects planned for when the opportunity arises to pitch your ideas. 

### 10. `Take your favorite genre, bring new elements to it and turn it on its head`

Identify, know the key elements of your favourite genre and try to actively subvert them, expant upon them in your work. Make the blueprint your own in a new, interesting way.

### 11. `Don't be afraid and write the most exciting, the most unexpected story you can think of`

Conside yourself two separate entities: a Writer and a Director. When beeing the writer of your screenplay don't limit yourself with director's budgetary and studio concerns. Write what you want to see. Chalange yourself as a director to overcome the creative problems posed by your Writer side.
