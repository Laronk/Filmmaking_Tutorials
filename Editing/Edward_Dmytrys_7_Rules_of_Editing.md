Hollywood Ten film director Edward Dmytryk’s 7 rules of editing, all the way from the days of film (something to bear in mind), are still relevant in the digital era. Here I will interpret them and relate them to modern films.

### 1. `Never make a cut without a positive reason`

* remain with current shot only as long as this is the best shot in capturing the content necessary to engage the audience
* If this is not the reason for a cut, then there is no real positive reason for a cut

### 2. `When undecided about the exact frame to cut on, cut long rather than short`

* rule more to working with film
* rule for treating the editing process in subtractive manner
* start with identifing the best shots, you can always cut the redundant frames later

### 3. `Whenever possible cut ‘in movement’`

* the movement can be subtle
* this brings a sense of fluidity to the scene
* movement in transitions helps smooth the process for the audience (makes cuts less noticable)

### 4. `The ‘fresh’ shot is preferable to the ‘stale’`

* our brains get bored quickly, do not bore the audience
* the audience is smart enough to recognize the reused shot (nobody likes to feel played)

### 5. `All scenes should begin and end with continuing action`

* there should be something significant to the plot of the scene or the film itself to begin and end the scene
* anything in the build up to the significant action should merely be a director’s choice on set and should be omitted from the edit

### 6. `Cut for proper values rather than proper ‘matches’`

* cut to keep the drama in not the logical movements or continuity

### 7. `Substance first — then form`

* the dramatic content should be prioritized over the structure of the edit
* Audiences will be entertained more so by the quality of the drama than the structure of the edit.
