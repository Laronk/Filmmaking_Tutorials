# Editing for comedy, 13.11.2023

## This Guy Edits: ["Youâ€™ll Never Edit an Unfunny Film Again."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Mafk58zS0)

Core idea: `BECOME A FILMMAKER WHO EDITS, NOT JUST AN EDITOR WHO CUTS FILMS`

---

### 1. `YES, AND...`

(A lesson from improvised comedy)

Don't stop progression of the scene with negativity. Always run with an idea you are presented with.

### 2. `SETUP IS PRIMARY`

When the joke is not working, do not blame the punchline.
Analyze the setup to the joke itself. There lie most joke writing problems.

Best dramas are interlaced with jokes (eg. Good Fellas), and best comedies have a dramatic premise.

### 3. `PLOT OVER JOKES`

Plot is more important than the jokes. Tell less jokes overall, but focus on the individual jokes quality.

You can not improvise story!

### 4. `FASTER IS FUNNIER`

Make the comedy pasing as fast as possible. Maximize JPM (Jokes Per Minute), not by telling more B-quality jokes, but by cutting all the "dead" material from in between the A-quality jokes.

Tip: Use the last takes of source material. They tend to have faster action.

### 5. `FIND THE BUTTON`

Last strongest / biggest laugh is called "The Button".
Finish the scene with the button. Enter the scene as late as possible and finish it as soon as the button hits the audience.

Great scripts should have the button already placed at the end of a scene. Sometimes the true button will reveal itself only in editing. You should then find a way to end the scene earlier - on the real button.

### 6. `TRIM THE FAT`

"The enemy of comedy is the unnecessary pause"

There should never be a pause in comedy unless you decide the pause is supposed to be the joke.

If the person speaking is not on-screen the editor has total control over the dialogue. Then there is no reason to have a pause or a "... you know" (or any other filler dialogue).

### 7. `CUT WIDE`

"Drama is a close-up, comedy is a wide shot."

If you want the scene to be funnier cut wider. You want to see the characters body language - it conveys a lot of comedy mostly through awkwardness of their movements and postures.

### 8. `FEATURE EVERY FRAME`

Feature every frame of the punchline. Do not cut away from the punchline delivering actor / moment. Use more tight / narrow / closer shots if possible.

You will know when the punchline is over when it makes you laugh.

### 9. `KEEP IT REAL`

Find the honesty in comedy.
A good comedian comments about society and tells people the truth the way it is.

When choosing the honest performance look for in eyes - you can tell when the actor is connected with the performance they are giving.

### 10. `BE A FILMMAKER WHO EDITS`

Do not just edit films. Study filmmaking. Study old film classics. Observer the language of filmmaking. Make your own movies. Gain insight to the filmmaking process and other jobs around it - relate the insight to editing.
