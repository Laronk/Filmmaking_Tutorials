## This Guy Edits: ["Top 5 Most Common Problems with Student Films"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpZaWyQa800)

---

### 1. **`Refusing to answer the question: "What is this film about?"`**

**The mistake:**

* **Film is not about the plot** (yes, even the films about real events are not about the events themselves, but about the characters experiencing and affected by those events)

**Solution:**

* **Know your theme**. It is what the audience connects to on a deeper level.

### 2. **`Repeated emotional beats`**

**The mistake:**

The same emotion is being expreesed without complication or escalation, without subtext and often without consequences. (the film is emotionaly flatlining - audience becomes bored)

**Solution:**

* Turn your 20 page script into core 2 pages packed with emotions and "golden" milestones on the character's emotional journey
* Cut out the boring, redundant stuff

### 3. **`Dialogue as exposition`**

**The mistake:**

* Actors saying what they are doing (eg. actor says their leaving, while leaving)
* Dialogue as information

**Solution:**

* Get rid of the line of dialogue or turn it into an action
* Dialogue should build characters
* Work with actors actions more

### 4. **`Casting and performance problems`**

**The mistake:**

Casting is extremely hard. Students dont spend enough time on it.

**Solution:**

* Put in extra time and effort during casting. The director should be deeply involved in the casting process.
* In auditions, try to see actors performing not only the role for your film, but see their range in multiple other performances
* When access to the acting talent is sparse, adjust the script to fit/match the natural quirks and strong sides of your actor's performance

### 5. **`Mistaking your own experience for cinema`**

**The mistake:**

Do not make a film about what happened to you exactly. The result, although true, will most likely not be cinematic.

**Solution:**

* Extract the core truth from your experience and write a screenplay based on it
* Turn your experience into something universal. Make the average viewer connect with the film on a primorial level
